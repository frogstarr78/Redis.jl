# Redis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frogstarr78/Redis.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frogstarr78/Redis.jl)

Redis Client implemented in Julia.

# I didn't realize there was already one
# I wanted something with which to learn a little Julia

So really this is just a pet project. I'm not sure how far it will get.
